# Separation-of-terbium-from-proton-irradiated-gadolinium-oxide-targets

## Overview
This repository accompanies the project detailed in [Paper Title/Reference]. The included Python scripts were used to (i) calculate expected yields from proton irradiations of natGd₂O₃ targets, (ii) perform efficiency calibarion of a High Purity Germanium (HPGe) spectrometer, and (iii) automate the analysis of serial HPGe spectra. In addition to computational work, the first version of the "**Terbinator**", a remote-controlled valve and pump module, was built to semi-automate multi-column extraction chromatographic serpations for ¹⁵⁵Tb. 

All code developed for this project has been consolidated into a single Python library, libname, which will continue to be developed into a comprehensive package desinged for applications in nuclear physics, nulcear chemistry, radiochemicstry, and machine learning challenges in radiopharmaceutical development. Source code and tutorials for libname v0.0.x are provided in this repostiory.

A detailed description with links of the contents of the repository are listed below.

## Repository Contents

### Python Modules
1. **`yield_calc.py`** – Implements the `Yield` class. Calculates theoretical end-of-bombardment (EoB) activity yields for irradiated targets.
2. **`calibration.py`** – Implements the `Calibration` class. Streamlines workflows for HPGe detector efficiency calibration.
3. **`serial.py`** – Implements the `Serial` class. Provides a pipeline for automated analysis of serial γ-spectra measurements.
4. **`nuclear_physics_utils.py`** – A collection of utility functions used internally by `yield_calc.py`, `calibration.py`, and `serial.py`.

### Workflow Tutorials
- **`workflows/`** – Contains interactive **Google Colab** Juypter notebooks demonstrating how to use each core class:
  - `calibration_to_serial_workflow.ipynb`
  - `yield_workflow.ipynb`

### Data Acquisition
- **`data_acquisition/`** – Example JOB files for automated HPGe spectrum collection using MAESTRO (Windows v7.01, ORTEC®).
  - Includes example JOB files with compatible file naming conventions for automated spectrum recording.
  - May also include Linux/Python scripts for automatically renaming files as needed.

## Setup Instructions

You have three options for using the libname package:

- **Option 1: Pip Install (recommended)**  
  *(Coming soon, once available on PyPI)*
  ```bash
  pip install <package-name>
  ```
- **Option 2: Clone the Repository**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivektara24/Separation-of-terbium-from-proton-irradiated-gadolinium-oxide-targets.git
cd Separation-of-terbium-from-proton-irradiated-gadolinium-oxide-targets
```

If you only need specfic files (e.g, `serial.py`, `utils.py`), you can fetch them directly with `wget` / `curl`:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vivektara24/Separation-of-terbium-from-proton-irradiated-gadolinium-oxide-targets/main/serial.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vivektara24/Separation-of-terbium-from-proton-irradiated-gadolinium-oxide-targets/main/utils.py
```

- **Option 3: Download as ZIP (no git required)**  
1. Navigate to this repository's main page on GitHub
2. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**.
3. Unzip it on your computer.

#### Step 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using the provided `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3. Run the Example
Try the tutorial in `example.py` to verify your installation.
```python
python example.py
```
## Example Output of Serial Class

## `.Spe` File Naming Convention  

Important experimental details are encoded directly in the `.Spe` filenames.  

In the `process_spectrum_files` method of the `Serial` class, each `.Spe` file is read and its filename is split on hyphens (`-`). The parser looks for a token of the form **`d1sXXX`** (e.g., `d1s200`), where `XXX` are digits representing the distance (in cm) between the sample and the face of the HPGe detector.  

This distance token is required to perform inverse-square law corrections when the measurement geometry differs from the HPGe calibration geometry. The token may appear anywhere in the filename, as long as it is a hyphen-delimited part.  

#### ✅ Valid Filenames  

1. `120-Min-Decay-Report-d1s200-001.Spe`  
2. `30-Min-Background-d1s5.Spe`  
3. `1-Hr-Scan-something-d1s42-more.Spe`  

#### ❌ Invalid Filenames  

1. `120-Min-Decay-Report-d1sABC-001.Spe` *(non-numeric value after `d1s`)*  
2. `120-Min-Decay-Report-DS1-001.Spe` *(incorrect token spelling/case)*  
3. `120-Min-Decay-Report-001.SPE` *(missing `d1s` token; case-sensitive extension may also cause issues)*

Example `.JOB` files for automated HPGe spectrum collection using **ORTEC® MAESTRO for Windows (v7.01)** are provided in the [`data_acquisition/`](data_acquisition/) directory of this repository. These job files define acquisition parameters and save spectra with filenames following the convention above.


## Package Improvment Ideas

1. peak summing in calibration class
2. the two methods in Knoll for HPGe detectors
3. optimzation techniques for yield class, using rx.Integrate maybe.
