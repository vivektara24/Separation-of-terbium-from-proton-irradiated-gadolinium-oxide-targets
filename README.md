# Separation-of-terbium-from-proton-irradiated-gadolinium-oxide-targets


## Overview
This repository accompanies the project detailed in **_Separation of terbium from proton-irradiated gadolinium oxide targets – development of an effective, scalable and automatable process_ (Applied Radiation and Isotopes, 2025)** — see [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apradiso.2025.112138](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apradiso.2025.112138).
 The included Python scripts were used to (i) calculate expected yields from proton irradiations of natGd₂O₃ targets, (ii) perform efficiency calibarion of a High Purity Germanium (HPGe) spectrometer, and (iii) automate the analysis of serial HPGe spectra. In addition to computational work, the first version of the "**Terbinator**", a remote-controlled valve and pump module, was built to semi-automate multi-column extraction chromatographic serpations for ¹⁵⁵Tb. 

All code developed for this project has been consolidated into a single Python library, **nuclab**, which will continue to be developed into a comprehensive package desinged for applications in nuclear physics, nulcear chemistry, radiochemicstry, and machine learning challenges in radiopharmaceutical development. Source code and tutorials for **nuclab** are provided in this repostiory. Representative example outputs are shown below.

## Methods

Activity is defined as the number of nuclear decays per unit time (1 Bq = 1 decay/second). Pulse-mode detectors are instruments designed to register each individual quantum of radiation interacting with the detector. A spectrometer is a specialized type of pulse-mode detector that also measures the energy of each quantum, producing a radiation energy spectrum as its output. To determine the activity of a multi-radionuclide sample, a spectrometer can be used to measure the net counts within energy peaks associated with specific radionuclides, from which the corresponding activities can be calculated.

Uncharged radiations such as gamma rays or neutrons must first undergo interaction in the detector before detection is possible. Because these radiations can travel large distances between interactions, detectors are often less that 100% efficient. It is neccesary to have a precise figure for the detector efficiency in order to relate the number of pulses counted to the number of neutrons or photons incident on the detector. The `Calibration` class is used to determine absolute detector effiicienies, which are dependent not only on detector properties but also on details of the counting geomtery defined as

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\epsilon_{abs}=\frac{\text{number%20of%20pulses%20recorded}}{\text{number%20of%20radiation%20quanta%20emitted%20by%20source}})


Over the course of an HPGe meaurment the source decays away exponentially. Such that the counts that the detector observes if the meauremnt time is long compared with the half-life of the activity

## Package Improvment Ideas

1. peak summing in calibration class
2. the two methods in Knoll for HPGe detectors
3. optimzation techniques for yield class, using rx.Integrate maybe.
5. provide more informative statistics for qulatiy of curve fit
7. warning messages if attributes arent filled before calling the functions
9. Give default values based on work
10. save eff_fit_params
